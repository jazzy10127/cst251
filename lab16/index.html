		<h1>Lab 16 </h1>
		<div id=main>
			<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p> use colums, animation, transition, and more backgrounds to decorate our accesskey
			webpages</p>
		</nav>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p>  i had a lot of problems with this lab. the animationa and backgrounds
				didn't work. I used the codes showed in the slides and in w3schools and
				it seemed as though none of the codes seemed to work. I asked sara for
				 help because i was out of town and needed help understanding some of
			 assighnment. She helped me undertsand it but when it was applied it didn't
			 work. this lab was very difficult for me. i can't understand why the new
		 codes aren't working. </p>
		</nav>

			<h2> Results</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p> there are blank backgrounds the text was moved to the bottom, the animated
			image is on the right side of the webpage and the colums don't seem to work
		either. </p>
		</nav>

		<div id="animated">
			<img src="../img/thanksgiving.png" width="225" height="450">
