			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<p> Hello world my name is Jasmine H. I grew up in the Monterey Bay area my entire life.
				I have five siblings, two older sisters,  two younger sisters and one baby brother.
				I live with my dad and one older sister. I have three nephews I pick up my 4 year old nephew on wednesday's.
				I usually take the bus around town because my dad uses my car for work.
				I work part time but stometimes full time	at costco. I have a fiance that's is currently
				training for the army. I write to him	every day and send him letters every Tuesday's and
				Saturday's. I have a terrible sleep schedule, I usually go to sleep between the hours
				2AM - 4 AM. I like to draw sometimes, one of my art peices won honerable mention at a
				contest at seaside's city hall. Another drawing won first place at my schools arts and
				media contest. I am an aries and they are known to be extroverted but I am not. I am always

			<p> My partner Sara is really kind. She's an active listener and is easy to talk to. She's always willing to help
				whenever I ask. For example when I was doing the "Free Codes Camp" she was able to help me learn how to put an image
				into the assigned website. Since she's always willing to help me whenever she asks something of me I help the best
				that I can. We got to know each other by the second class when we worked on our website hunt assignment. Working
				with Sara is really fun and I'm glad we got to become partner with each other.</p>
